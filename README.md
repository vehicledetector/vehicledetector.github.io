Vehicle Detector is an application that helps the owners to track their vehicle when they get lost by using the vehicle’s unique information. Our main goal is to provide the owner’s with a searching facility across the city using Public Camera, GPS and mobile capturing technique without raising the complaint to the cop. In this system, the user can share their vehicle’s individual identity and it will be stored on the user database. When the vehicle gets lost, the owner can ping on this platform about the vehicle lost. 

On the other side data gets fetched and stored on a common database. If the information in both of these databases get matched, the user/owner will receive a notification with an exact location or else they can wait until it gets found. If there is any server issues or fraudulent information, then this whole system is taken care of by the admin. Hence this platform made the owners find the vehicle without any police complaints.
